# Phys 499 Research -- ABCD Method 
Work done for Gordon and Search for Hidden Sector group

At the start of working with the Hidden Sector group at the University of Washington (Physics Department) I had little knowledge of particle of high energy physics. During my time working with the group I studied the basics of particle physics, including The Standard Model, the Quark Model, Symmetries and interactions.
